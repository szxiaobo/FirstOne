## Project 1
Like everyone else, we transitioned to fully-remote work during the pandemic.  We’re now in the process of transitioning back into the office (RTO = “return to office”), with most employees being requested to come back 3 days per week.  This is the policy from corporate, but Rob has let us know that we can exercise flexibility in our implementation.  The guidance I have given to the team is that we should aim for at least 2 days in the office out of every 2-week sprint.  (There is a schedule for teams’ in-office presence on our team calendar (EDS Calendar).  In addition, we have some employees who never come to the office due to personal circumstances (high-risk household members or residing outside commuting range).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53539226/140530780-3f572da6-988b-4753-9ee6-4005680ff615.png)
